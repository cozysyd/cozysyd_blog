                <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">Why I started this blog</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">November 20, 2023 by <a href="about.html">Sydney</a></p>
        
                <p>Wondering why this blog now exist on the Internet for all to see? Read on below to hear how this journey started!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Hello Internet and fellow Cozy Game enthusiasts! Welcome to my playful corner of the internet where I share my love of cozy gaming with the world - along with some of my other hobbies that have encouraged more “play time” in my adult life.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This blog became a passion project of mine after starting some social media accounts under the Cozy Syd name and decided I wanted a longer form method of sharing my musings with the world. At the same time of this idea, I was in the thick of learning how to design websites while working on a certificate in Front End Development, so it felt like the perfect time to develop my own personal blog site.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My twenties have been somewhat of a whirlwind with experiences that I’m sure many will resonate with. Finding a career path after college, navigating the early stages of adulthood, and trying to find meaning and enjoyment in my day to day. All while the world experiences a global pandemic and economic turmoil.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I struggled to find motivation and ambition when it felt like everything around me was in shambles, but as I settled into a new routine post-quarantine, I adapted to a slower pace of living that felt nice. Instead of constantly going and going from my apartment to work to happy hour to making dinner and doing chores then to my bedroom where I would zone out, dreading having to do it all again the next day, I had more time to stop and reflect. What made me happy? What did I really want out of life?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I suddenly found myself doing things I hadn’t done since I was a kid - reading fantasy books, writing my own stories, scrapbooking, and playing video games. At first I felt guilty. None of these pursuits were advancing my career or making me money. Then I stopped caring, because for the first time in a while, I felt present and happy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For some reason, we grow up and think play time, aka activities without an end goal or a deadline, must end. I wanted to start my web presence as Cozy Syd to encourage more people to reject that mentality, to take more time for themselves to do things because you want to. Not necessarily because you’re particularly good at it or you feel it’ll lead to making money, but because you genuinely love it. On this website, I’ll be primarily talking about cozy video games like Animal Crossing or Disney Dreamlight Valley, but I also aspire to share other interests of mine as well as maybe try new ones. My hope is that you, dear reader, will be inspired to do the same. Stay tuned for more!</p>
